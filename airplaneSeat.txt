Take their own seat if it is still available, and
Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied
Return the probability that the nth person gets his own seat.

public:
    double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(float n) {
        float res = 0;
        if(n == 1){
            res = 1;
        }
        else{
            res = 0.5;
        }

        return res;
